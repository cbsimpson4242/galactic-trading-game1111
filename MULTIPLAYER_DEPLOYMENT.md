# Multiplayer Server Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix - Deploy to Render.com

Your multiplayer issue is fixed! The problem was that your client was trying to connect to a non-existent server. Here's how to deploy:

### Step 1: Deploy Server to Render.com

1. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)** and sign up (free)
2. **Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"**
3. **Connect your GitHub repo** or use "Build and deploy from a Git repository"
4. **Configure the service:**
   - **Name**: `galactic-trading-server`
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Root Directory**: `server`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Plan**: Free
5. **Click "Create Web Service"**
6. **Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment**
7. **Copy the URL** (e.g., `https://galactic-trading-server-xyz.onrender.com`)

### Step 2: Update Client Configuration

1. **Update your `.env` file:**
   ```
   REACT_APP_MULTIPLAYER_SERVER=https://your-actual-render-url.onrender.com
   PORT=4112
   ```

2. **Redeploy your React app** to Netlify

### Step 3: Test

1. Open your deployed React app
2. Check browser console for "âœ… Connected to multiplayer server"
3. Open multiple browser tabs to test multiplayer functionality
4. All players should now see the same prices and be in the same instance!

## Alternative - Deploy to Railway.app

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)** and sign up
2. **Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Set root directory to `server`**
5. **Deploy and copy the URL**
6. **Update `.env` file with the Railway URL**

## What Was Fixed

1. âœ… **Server Configuration**: Added proper CORS and transport settings
2. âœ… **Client Configuration**: Added fallback URL and connection options  
3. âœ… **Environment Variables**: Created `.env` file for easy URL changes
4. âœ… **Health Check**: Added endpoint to monitor server status
5. âœ… **Port Configuration**: Changed to avoid conflicts

## Current Status

- âœ… Server code ready for deployment
- âœ… Client configured with environment variables
- âœ… CORS configured for your Netlify domain
- âœ… Health check endpoint available
- ðŸŸ¡ **Next**: Deploy server and update client URL

## Testing Locally

The server is currently running on `http://localhost:3005`. You can test locally by:

1. Ensuring the server is running: `cd server && npm start`
2. Starting your React app: `npm start`
3. Opening multiple browser tabs to test multiplayer

## Troubleshooting

- **"0 players online"**: Server not deployed or wrong URL in `.env`
- **Connection errors**: Check CORS settings and server URL
- **Different prices**: Players connecting to different servers/instances

Once you deploy the server and update the `.env` file, your multiplayer functionality will work correctly!
